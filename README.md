### README.md - Speech Recognition with Python

#### Overview

This Python script demonstrates the usage of the SpeechRecognition library to transcribe audio files using Google Speech Recognition and PocketSphinx. The script provides examples for transcribing two audio files, `harvard.wav` and `moha.wav`, using different recognition engines.

#### Instructions

1. **Installation**

   Ensure that you have the `speech_recognition` library installed:
   ```bash
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   ```

2. **Audio Files**

   Make sure you have the audio files, `harvard.wav` and `moha.wav`, in the same directory as the script.

3. **Adjusting Duration**

   The script transcribes `harvard.wav` for up to 60 seconds and `moha.wav` for up to 10 seconds. Adjust these durations based on your audio files.

4. **Running the Script**

   Execute the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

#### Code Explanation

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize the Recognizer
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Load audio files
harvard = sr.AudioFile('./harvard.wav')
moha = sr.AudioFile('./moha.wav')

# Adjust for ambient noise and record audio
with harvard as source:
    r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
    audio1 = r.record(source, duration=60)

with moha as source:
    r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
    audio2 = r.record(source, duration=10)

# Transcribe using Google Speech Recognition
try:
    transcription1 = r.recognize_google(audio1, language='en-US', show_all=True)
    print("Transcription 1: ", transcription1)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio 1")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service for audio 1; {0}".format(e))

# Transcribe second audio file
try:
    transcription2 = r.recognize_google(audio2, language='en-US', show_all=True)
    print("Transcription 2: ", transcription2)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Google Speech Recognition could not understand audio 2")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service for audio 2; {0}".format(e))

# Example using the Sphinx recognizer
try:
    transcription_sphinx = r.recognize_sphinx(audio1)
    print("Sphinx Transcription: ", transcription_sphinx)
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Sphinx could not understand audio 1")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print("Could not request Sphinx results; {0}".format(e))

# Customization using a user-specific language model (not a direct implementation, requires additional steps)
# CustomModel = ...  # Load or train a custom language model
# try:
#     transcription_custom = r.recognize_custom(audio1, model=CustomModel)
#     print("Custom Transcription: ", transcription_custom)
# except CustomModelError as e:
#     print("Error in custom recognition; {0}".format(e))
```

#### Notes

- Adjust the durations according to the length of your audio files.
- Ensure proper dependencies for Google Speech Recognition and Sphinx.
- Follow additional steps if using a custom language model.
