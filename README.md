    Scipy is used for mathematical and scientific computations but can also perform 
    multi-dimensional image processing using the submodule **scipy.ndimage**. 
    It provides functions to operate on n-dimensional Numpy arrays 
    and at the end of the day images are just that.

# Speech Recognition Script

This Python script demonstrates how to transcribe audio files using the SpeechRecognition library, utilizing both Google Speech Recognition and PocketSphinx.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```
    pip install SpeechRecognition
    ```
3. Place your audio files in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script using Python:
    ```
    python speech_recognition_script.py
    ```

## Functionality

- The script loads audio files named `harvard.wav` and `moha.wav`.
- It adjusts for ambient noise for both audio files.
- Transcribes the audio files using Google Speech Recognition.
- Demonstrates how to use PocketSphinx for transcription.
- Includes a commented-out section for custom language models.

## Customization

- Adjust the duration parameter for audio files according to your requirements.
- If you want to use custom language models, define or load them and uncomment the appropriate section in the script.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the required audio files in the same directory as the script.
- Be mindful of the rate limits and usage policies associated with using the Google Speech Recognition service.
